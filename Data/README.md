# Predictive Maintenance Data for Vehicle Systems

This project focuses on the **Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Data Set** (Saxena and Goebel 2008) from NASAâ€™s Prognostics Data Repository. The dataset consists of time-series sensor data simulating turbofan engines operating under various conditions until failure. It is designed to support predictive maintenance modeling by capturing real-time degradation patterns in high-stress components.

The dataset allows researchers to develop models for early detection of engine faults, contributing to safer and more efficient maintenance strategies in aerospace applications. Each engine in the dataset experiences different levels of initial wear, operational conditions, and fault development, creating a robust testing environment for predictive maintenance algorithms.

### Dataset Summary
- **FD001**: 100 train and 100 test trajectories, one operational condition (Sea Level) and one fault mode (HPC Degradation).
- **FD002**: 260 train and 259 test trajectories, six operational conditions and one fault mode (HPC Degradation).
- **FD003**: 100 train and 100 test trajectories, one operational condition (Sea Level) and two fault modes (HPC Degradation, Fan Degradation).
- **FD004**: 248 train and 249 test trajectories, six operational conditions and two fault modes (HPC Degradation, Fan Degradation).

## Description of the Dataset
The dataset comprises multiple multivariate time series divided into training and test subsets. Each time series represents the operation of a different engine within a simulated fleet, starting with varying degrees of initial wear and manufacturing variation. Engines operate normally at the beginning of each series and develop faults over time until failure.

The training set includes full degradation cycles until failure, while the test set ends before failure, with the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) values provided for evaluation. The dataset includes three operational settings affecting engine performance and 26 sensor measurements capturing operational metrics. 

This structured dataset is ideal for developing and validating predictive maintenance models for early fault detection and maintenance planning.
