# Enhancing Predictive Maintenance for Turbofan Engines

This repository focuses on developing a predictive maintenance model for turbofan engines using the NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Dataset. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, the project aims to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of engines based on sensor data, enabling proactive maintenance strategies and minimizing unexpected failures.

## Project Overview

The project is centered on predictive maintenance for high-performance turbofan engines. The NASA dataset provides multivariate time-series data from simulated engines, capturing operational metrics and degradation over time. The goal is to develop a model capable of accurately predicting the RUL for engines under various operational conditions.

Key highlights of the project include:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalizing, and preparing time-series data for model training.
- **LSTM Model Development**: Building and training a deep learning model to capture temporal dependencies in the data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and visualizing prediction accuracy.
