## Statement of Intellectual and Professional Growth
This project was an incredible learning journey that combined theoretical knowledge and practical application of machine learning to address real-world challenges. Through this project, we:  
- Gained hands-on experience in **time-series data analysis**, working with large multivariate datasets.  
- Explored advanced machine learning models, including **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks and **Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)**.  
- Enhanced skills in **data preprocessing**, **model evaluation**, and **explainability techniques** using **SHAP**.  
- Improved professional competencies such as **problem-solving**, **team collaboration**, and **communication of technical results**.  
This project has significantly contributed to our growth, equipping us with the confidence and expertise to tackle future challenges in predictive analytics and machine learning.

## Navigation Instructions

### Code for Simulations and Visualizations
The main code for this project is organized into two Jupyter notebooks:  
1. **Enhancing_Predictive_Maintenance_for_Turbofan_Engines.ipynb**: Implements LSTM-based predictive maintenance.  
2. **TCN_and_Visualization_using_SHAP.ipynb**: Implements TCN-based predictive maintenance and SHAP-based explainability.  

Both notebooks are available in the `Code` directory and can be executed in Google Colab:
- [LSTM Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DL0-iba6HReCSmTpzFwX3IJCCE68inaf#scrollTo=W_mD1ptTbSNs)  
- [TCN and SHAP Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_uNJm4qtow-2Esn_ZCvqRnrXpzeZ2Lc1#scrollTo=x_NrR6PfzNpH)  

### Datasets and Preprocessing Steps
- The dataset used in this project is the **NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Dataset**, available in the `Data` folder.  
- Preprocessing steps are detailed in both notebooks, involving data cleaning, normalization, and preparation for training machine learning models.

### Documentation and Dependencies
- Documentation, including the project report, is available in the `Docs` directory.  
- A list of required dependencies is provided in the `installed_packages.txt` file within the `Docs` directory.
